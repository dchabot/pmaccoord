\mainpage pmacCoord EPICS Support Module
\section intro_sec Introduction
This module contains an asyn motor driver for Delta Tau PMAC co-ordinate systems
(CS), along with some sample CS definitions. This allows the programmer to set
axes to move in a synchronised fashion according to arbitrary mathematical 
transfer functions. For instance it allows 3 vertical jacks of a table to scan 
pitch at a constant velocity, or the bragg and vertical axes of a DCM to scan
energy linearly. There is a great deal of information on writing CSs in the
<a href="http://www.deltatau.com/manuals/pdfs/TURBO%20PMAC%20USER%20MANUAL.pdf">
Delta Tau Turbo PMAC User Manual</a> p275 (Coordinate-System Kinematic Calculations).
This documentation will not cover this in detail, but will focus on how to setup
the EPICS driver and associated databases.

\section build_sec Build
Make sure you have the following modules built and defined in configure/RELEASE:
- asyn
- motor
- tpmac
- streamDevice

There is an example IOC for each available CS in the iocs/ directory. 
Initially, it is recommended you comment out the build of the examples in the 
Makefile in the directory root, then try and build the module. You can they try 
changing the configure/RELEASE file and building an example. Each IOC contains
a file defs.pmc in the root which contains an instantiated pmc file with the
CS definitions that can be loaded onto a PMAC using PEWinPro

\section driver_sec CS Driver
To see detailed information on how the EPICS driver communicates to the lower
level see:

\section CS_sec Supplied CS definitions
The following co-ordinate system definitions are supplied, you can use these
as is, or as a template for writing your own. Make sure you read the 
<a href="../BLS-GEN-CTRL-0005.doc">DLS PMAC Programming Standards</a>
document before writing your own.
